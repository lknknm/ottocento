# Ottocento Renderer

![Ottocento Renderer](./doc/assets/img/Ottocento_Screenshot.jpg)

Ottocento Renderer is a study project developed by Lucas M. with the intent of learning the building blocks of Raytracing and Graphics Programming in C++. The core idea is to build a basic rendering application with a codebase that can be used as a model for new experiments, mainly focused on learning the algorithms, architecture/design patterns, performance optimizations and math related to the different sides of computer graphics. It is important to notice that, since this is a study project, most of the features of a regular rendering application will be missing, as well as sophisticated optimization algorithms. Still, I hope to learn each concept to the best of my ability as I go.

This project is highly resourced from [The Cherno's](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno) [Ray Tracing series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW1Fhd9u9Q&list=PLlrATfBNZ98edc5GshdBtREv5asFW3yXl), available in his YouTube Channel, as well as using the [RayTracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) book, also recommended by Cherno. Both are really great to understand many of the core concepts of RayTracing. I will also leave other links in the `Resources` topic.

This application uses an app template from [Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut), developed by Studio Cherno — unlike the example within the Walnut repository, this keeps Walnut as an external submodule and is much more sensible for actually building applications. See the [Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut) repository for more details.

## How to build from source
Once you've cloned, run `scripts/Setup.bat` to generate Visual Studio 2022 solution/project files. Your app is located in the `WalnutApp/` directory, which some basic example code to get you going in `WalnutApp/src/WalnutApp.cpp`.

### Documentation
 - To see how we style our code, please refer to the [Code Style Guide](/doc/styleguide.md).
 - A proper development report with my progress is in the works.
